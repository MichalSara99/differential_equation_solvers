# Differential Equation Solvers
While studying [Singular Perturbation Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Singular-Perturbation-Theory-Mathematical-Applications/dp/0387232001)
and [Introduction to Perturbation Techniques](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Perturbation-Techniques-Ali-Nayfeh/dp/0471080330/ref=sr_1_9?qid=1568131377&refinements=p_27%3AAli+H.+Nayfeh&s=books&sr=1-9&text=Ali+H.+Nayfeh) 
I needed some DE (Differential Equation) solvers to confirm that my solutions were 
correct since only the second book has solutions for few exercises and some of them seemed
to be incorrect. I started writting very simple stuff and it has evolved into what you see above.
As you can see it is not at all complete.I will keep coding more. 

## Methods for differential equations
### Euler Method
* first, second and third-order differential equation solver
* solver for system of two and three first-order differential equations
* few examples in header file euler_method_t.h

### Taylor Series Method
* first, second and third-order differential equation solver of second order (TS(2))
* solver for system of two and three first-order differential equations of second order (TS(2))
* WIP on TS(3)

### Linear Multistep Methods
* WIP


## Usage
Just started building...Useful are header files ending with _t.
